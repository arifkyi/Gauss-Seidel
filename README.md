# Gauss-Seidel
Perl script to run and solve the linear equation with multidimentional Matrix by running the Perl Script.

Prerequisite: full understanding of Liebeman method and Gauss-Seidel

<b> History </b>

In abbreviated explanation, Liebeman created the method in linear equation to solve the matrix of multidimention
factor.
However The prince of Mathematicion and Seidel developed new way to solve the linear question that shorter and easier war 

<b> How To </b>

1. create input file from the equations,

     10x-1y+2z+0v=6  
   
   -1x+11y-1z+3v=25 
   
    2x-1y+10z-1v=-11
     
     0x+3y-1z+8v=15  

in file format would be like this:

    10,-1,2,0=6;0;

    -1,11,-1,3=25;0;

   2,-1,10,-1=-11;0;

     0,3,-1,8=15;0;

save it as any name you like, example <b>myinput.txt</b>

<b> Run </b>

<b> "perl PrinceOfMathv5.pl myinput.txt" </b>
