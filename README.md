# Gauss-Seidel
Perl script to run and solve the linear equation with multidimentional Matrix by running the Perl Script.

Prerequisite: full understanding of Liebeman method and Gauss-Seidel

<b> History </b>

In abbreviated explanation, Liebeman created the method in linear equation to solve the matrix of multidimention
factor.
However The prince of Mathematician, Gauss'  and Siede invented new way to solve the linear question that shorter and easier war 

<b> Prerequisite </b>
- Any OS that able to running perl, for windows can gain it by installing the Strawberry perl
- Perl version 5.10 above

<b> How To </b>

1. create input file from the equations:
     
     10x-1y+2z+0v=6;
     -1x+11y-1z+3v=25;
     2x-1y+10z-1v=-11;
     0x+3y-1z+8v=15;

in file format would be like this:

    10,-1,2,0=6;0;
    -1,11,-1,3=25;0;
    2,-1,10,-1=-11;0;
    0,3,-1,8=15;0;

save it as any name you like, example <b>myinput.txt</b>

<b> Run </b>

just run the script <b> "perl PrinceOfMathv5.pl myinput.txt" </b>

<b> Output </b>
